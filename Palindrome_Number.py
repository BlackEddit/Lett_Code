# Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
# palindrome
# , and false otherwise.
 

# Example 1:

# Input: x = 121
# Output: true
# Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
# Example 2:

# Input: x = -121
# Output: false
# Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
# Example 3:

# Input: x = 10
# Output: false
# Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

        # If x is negative, it's not a palindrome.

        # When the length is an odd number, we can get rid of the middle digit by revertedNumber/10
        # For example when the input is 12321, at the end of the while loop we get x = 12, revertedNumber = 123,
        # since the middle digit doesn't matter in palidrome (it will always equal to itself), we can simply get rid of it.
